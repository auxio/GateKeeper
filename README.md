Gatekeeper is a module that enables you (the server administrator) to easily view and change your Sentora server's web service (XMWS) API key.

## Requirements
his module will work on Sentora version 1.0.0 and upwards.

## Installation
You can install GateKeeper by logging into your server and running the following commands:

Firstly, you need to add the Auxio module repository (unless you already have it added):

```
zppy repo add auxio.github.io
zppy update
```

Then install the package like so:

```
zppy install gatekeeper
```

Now that you have it install, go and activate the module in the Sentora Module Admin!
